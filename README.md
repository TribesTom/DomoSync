DomoSync
========
DomoSync is a logicel suite to enhance my domotic installation.

It composed of  : Arduino code using Cosa libraries : https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa

                  C daemon inspired from UUGear code : https://github.com/shawnu/UUGear
                  
                  C client and Pyton client to interface with Domoticz ( TODO )


DomoSync daemon can connect to multiple Arduino Board at same time and clients can access all arduino board at same time.
It enhance UUGear at this point.

Arduino sketch can use Button classe from Cosa library which is usefull in domotic.
